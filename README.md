expert-engine
=============

Expert Engine is a search engine for patent attorneys to find the most 
appropriate people to serve as expert witnesses. At present, attorneys 
must rely on their own personal networks to find experts. This is 
inefficient and does not necessarily guarantee a strong pairing of 
experts with cases. Expert Engine seeks to eliminate these 
inefficiencies. The model currently responsible for recommending them is 
very simple and does not take advantage of all of the rich data that 
patents offer. The code here is intended to improve the algorithm so 
that the service can be not only faster than the traditional method of 
finding an expert but also guarantee the recommendation of highly 
qualified people.
