expert-engine
=============

Expertengine is a search engine for patent attorneys to find the most appropriate people to serve as expert witnesses. At present, attorneys must rely on their own personal networks to find experts. This is inefficient and does not necessarily guarantee a strong pairing of experts with cases. Expertengine seeks to eliminate these inefficiencies. The model currently responsible for recommending them is very simple and does not take advantage of all of the rich data that patents offer. The code here is intended to improve the algorithm so that the service can be not only faster than the traditional method of finding an expert but also guarantee the recommendation of highly qualified people.
